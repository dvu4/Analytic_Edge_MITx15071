#DETECTING FLU EPIDEMICS VIA SEARCH ENGINE QUERY DATAÂ 

#this sort of data is called "skew right" -->  handling a skewed dependent variable, it is often useful to predict the logarithm of the dependent variable instead of the dependent variable itself -- this prevents the small number of unusually large or small observations from having an undue influence on the sum of squared errors of predictive models.
